Updated version of the "Justice" tool found from [GBATemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-justice-freedom-wars-un-packer.440138/).

Unpacks (and repacks) Freedom Wars' EAF files. However, it does not decrypt/deflate them, so you have to use other [tools](http://aemods.pbworks.com/w/page/42053948/aetools) to do that.

Repacking does not produce the same binaries as the original ones, as they seem to have extra padding.
